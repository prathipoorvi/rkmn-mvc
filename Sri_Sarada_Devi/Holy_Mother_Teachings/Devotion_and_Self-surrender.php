<h1>What were Holy Mother's teachings on Devotion and Self-surrender?</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>At Udbodhan 1909</h3>
<p>As for those who depend upon God and have faith in Him, well, that itself is their spiritual practice, sadhana. God is one's very OWN. It is an eternal relationship. One realizes Him in proportion to the intensity of one's feeling for him. Don't be afraid. Always remember that somebody is protecting you.</p>
<p>If you love any human being you will have to suffer for it. That person is blessed, indeed, who can love God alone. There is no suffering in loving God.</p>
<p>Repeat the name of God always in the innermost core of your heart and in all sincerity take refuge in Sri Ramakrishna. Do not bother to know how your mind is reacting to things around. And do not waste time in calculating and worrying over whether or not you are progressing in the path of spirituality. It is egotism to judge progress for oneself. Have faith in the grace of your guru and God.</p>
<p>What does one become by realizing God? Does one get two horns? No. What happens is, the person develops discrimination between the real and the unreal, gets spiritual consciousness, and goes beyond life and death.</p>
<p>One who is able to renounce all for His sake is a living god. Even the decrees of fate are cancelled if one takes refuge in God. Fate strikes off with her own hand what she has written about such a person.</p>
<p>Those who are really anxious to cross the ocean of the world will somehow break their bonds. No one can entangle such people.</p>
<p>Does one get a faith by mere study of books? Too much reading creates confusion. Sri Ramakrishna used to say that one should learn from the scriptures that God alone is real and the world illusory.</p>
