<h1>What were Holy Mother's teachings on Instructions and Spiritual Practice?</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>At Jayrambati 1918</h3>
<p>Be sincere in your practice, words and deeds. You will feel blessed! His blessings are always showered on all creatures on the earth. It is needless to ask for it. Practice meditation sincerely and you will understand His infinite grace. God wants sincerity, truthfulness and love. Outward verbal effusions do not touch Him.</p>
<p>The more intensely a person practices spiritual disciplines, the more quickly he or she attains Godâ€¦ Those who spend their time idly, without practicing prayer and meditation, will take a long time to attain Him.</p>
<p>Continue to pray without losing your heart. Everything will happen in time. For how many cycles did the sages of old practice austerities to realize God, and do you believe you will attain him in a flash? Is it so easy to realize God? But this time Sri Ramakrishna has shown an easy path.</p>
<p>One has no control over illness, but even in the midst of illness or intense activity, one should at least remember God and salute him.</p>
<p>If you do not call upon God-indeed many people never even remember him-what does it matter to him? It is your own misfortune. Such is the maya of God; he keeps them ignorant of himself saying, "They are happy enough, let them be so!"</p>
<p>Don't puzzle the mind with too many inquiries. One finds it difficult to put one thing into practice, but dares invite distraction by filling the mind with too many things.</p>
<p>If the mind feels at rest in a particular place, there is no need of pilgrimage.</p>
<p>If you are constantly in touch with the objects of enjoyment, you are likely to succumb to their influence.</p>
