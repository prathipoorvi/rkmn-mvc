<h1>What were the teachings of Sri Ramakrishna?</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There are pearls in the deep sea, but one must hazard all to find them. If diving once does not bring you pearls, you need not therefore conclude that the sea is without them. Dive again and again. You are sure to be rewarded in the end. So is it with the finding of the Lord in this world. If your first attempt proves fruitless, do not lose heart. Persevere in your efforts. You are sure to realize Him at last.</p>
<h3>Ramakrishna's Teachings </h3>
<p>What are you to do when you are placed in the world? Give up everything to Him, resign yourself to Him, and there will be no more trouble for you. Then you will come to know that everything is done by His will.</p>
<p>Unalloyed love of God is the essential thing. All else is unreal</p>
<p>All religions are true. God can be reached by different religions. Many rivers flow by many ways but they fall into the sea. There all are one.</p>
<p>A truly religious man should think that other religions also are paths leading to truth. We should always maintain an attitude of respect towards other religions.</p>
<p>Money can fetch you bread alone. Do not consider it as your sole end and aim.</p>
<p>You see many stars in the sky at night, but nor when the sun rises. Can you therefore say that there are no stars in the heavens during the day? O man, because you cannot find God in the days of your ignorance, say not there is no God.</p>
<p>He is born in vain, who having attained the human birth, so difficult to get, does not attempt to realize God in this very life.</p>
<p>Seekest thou God ? Then seek Him in man ! His Divinity is manifest more in man than in any other object. Man is the greatest manifestation of God.</p>
<p>Jiva is Shiva (all living beings are God). Who then dare talk of showing mercy to them ? Not mercy, but service, service. For man must be regarded as God.</p>
<p>I tell you the truth : there is nothing wrong in your being in the world. But you must direct your mind towards God.</p>
<p>If you say, 'I am a sinner', eternally, you will remain a sinner to all eternity. You ought rather to repeat, 'I am not bound, I am not bound. Who can bind me ? I am the son of God, the king of kings.'</p>
<p>It is said that truthfulness alone constitutes the spiritual discipline of the Kaliyuga (i.e. modern age). If a man clings tenaciously to truth he ultimately realizes God.</p>
<p>He is truly a man to whom money is only a servant; but, on the other hand, those who do not know how to make a proper use of it, hardly deserve to be called men.</p>
<p>To become great one must be humble. The tree laden with fruit always bends low. So if you wish to be great, be lowly and meek.</p>
<p>Rain water never stands on high ground, but runs down to the lowest level. So also the mercy of God remains in the hearts of the lowly, but drains off from those of the vain and the proud.</p>
<p>The ego that asserts, 'I am the servant of God' is the characteristic of the true devotee. It is the ego of Vidya (Knowledge), and is called the 'ripe' ego.</p>
