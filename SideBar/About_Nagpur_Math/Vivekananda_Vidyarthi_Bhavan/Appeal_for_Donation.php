<h3>Vivekananda Vidyarthi Bhavan: An Appeal</h3>
<p>Dear Sir / Madam,</p>
<p>Namaskar and best wishes,</p>
<p>You are aware that Ramakrishna Math, Dhantoli, Nagpur, has been engaged in the Vivekananda Vidyarthi Bhavan - a hostel for college boys since 1932. Students taking education in various colleges affiliated to Nagpur University are admitted in this hostel. The Math bears all the expenses of boarding and lodging of some poor and deserving students. Special attention is paid to the all-round development of the students, through study circle and classes, its main aim being to make them ideal citizens so that they might build an India that Swami Vivekananda dreamed of.</p>
<p>We have already undertaken the construction of a new Vidyarthi Bhavan, which will house 50 students from rural poor section. The hostel will have Prayer Hall, Assembly and Recreation Hall with Dining/Kitchen Hall and Library (containing books on philosophy, religion, education, culture, literature, sociology, history, arts, science, biography, agriculture, etc. in various languages such as Sanskrit, Marathi, Hindi, English, Bengali, etc.) and also C.D. Library. It will also have best of the facilities for Computer Knowledge Lab., Sports (indoor and outdoor) /gymnasium, and Exhibition Hall emphasising the role of Spirituality and Human values for all-round personality development of the inmates of the Hostel.</p>
<p>In this regard we give below the details of the project under construction:</p>
<p>Length &amp; Breadth 121'x62' Under Ground Floor 29'x60'</p>
<p>Auditorium &amp; Gymnasium 29'x60' Library 29'x60'</p>
<p>Kitchen &amp; Dining Hall 29'x'60' Rooms 19'x13'</p>
<p>The projected cost earlier was Rs.1,68,00,000 which is likely to be around Rs.2,20,00,000/- due to steep rise in construction materials and labour charges etc. In addition to that we will be required to provide all the captioned facilities to the students which will also require additional financial help to the tune of Rs.64,00,000/- (approximately). Thus the total amount required for the said project would be approximately around Rs.2,84,00,000/-(Rupees two crore, eightyfour lacs).</p>
<p>An undertaking of this type and magnitude requires the goodwill and support of all the public, therefore we humbly request you to participate in this noble project and donate liberally for the humanitarian upliftment of the poor boys. Your contributions will be gratefully accepted and acknowledged.</p>
<p>May Sri Ramakrishna bless you all.</p>
