<h3>Religious and Cultural Preaching</h3>
<p>Each day begins with a morning prayer at 5.50 am and by offering worship. After sunset, Aarti is performed and prayers are offered. Every month on the Ekadashi days there is Ramnam Sankirtan after evening Aarti. The Birthday Anniversaries of Bhagawan Shri Ramakrishna, Shri Saradadevi, Swami Vivekananda and of the direct disciples are celebrated every year. On the occasion of the Birthday Anniversary of Bhagawan Shri Ramakrishna, a festival lasting for about a week is held annually in which programmes like Kirtan, Bhajan and lectures are organized.
