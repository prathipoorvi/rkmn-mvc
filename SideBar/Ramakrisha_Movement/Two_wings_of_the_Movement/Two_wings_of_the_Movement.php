<p>The Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Vedanta Movement is the revival in the present age of the universal religious spirit of Vedanta. It has found expression in twin institutions : the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. The Ramakrishna Math is a monastic institution, the principal purpose of which is to develop its members and lay devotees by means of spiritual practices, such as worship, prayer, meditation and study, and to train monks to be competent teachers of religion. The Ramakrishna Mission is a philanthropic body composed of both monastic and lay members. It is devoted to public service in various forms, such as religious, cultural, educational and social. Both the Math and the Mission have affiliated centers in different places in India and abroad.</p>
<p>Though distinct, the two organizations are interconnected. Both have their headquarters at Belur Math, District Howrah, situated five miles to the northwest of Calcutta, across the Ganges. The Board of Trustees of the Math is the governing body of the Mission under the same President, and the resident workers of the Mission Centers are mostly the monks of the Order. It is to be noted that the funds of each Center of the Math and the Mission are kept separate.</p>
